Here is big brother of ""BUSTER"" with tons of improvements and new features!

Classic console compressor with extra Filter and Transient sidechain options to dominate whole signal!

FEATURES

STEREO COMPRESSOR : Compressor Section

FLT : Filter Section

TR : Transient Section

CONTROL : Control section

Compressor Section

- THRESHOLD (dB) : +15 to -15

- ATTACK (ms) : 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30

- RELEASE (sec) : 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, Auto

- RATIO : 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10

- MAKE UP (dB) : 0 to 15

- MIX (%) : DRY to WET

Filter Section (Sidechain)

- HPF (Hz) : 20 to 500

- MID (~1500Hz) : -6dB to +6dB

- HF (~10kHz) : 0dB to -10dB *Will work like famous optical-tube compressor and help you to control high frequencies, better.

Transient Section (Sidechain)

- BOOST (dB) : 0 to 10 *While boosting attack, it will reduce decay/release of signal to make compressor more sensitive with only attacks/peaks.

- TILT (~1kHz Center) : -6dB to 6 dB *It's placed before BOOST to send only dedicated range to BOOST. So, BOOST will affect only given frequency range and will boost only this range's transients. If TILT is default, BOOST will affect overall transients.

- MIX (%) : DRY to WET *Will blend DRY and WET signal. After boosting transients, you can blend with DRY signal to keep reduced release of signal. When MIX in default position, TR is off. So, you can turn MIX knob to all the way up to engage TR section.

*EXT (External Sidechain) : When you engage EXT, sidechain circuit will listen incoming signal and you can stil use Filter and Transient sections on incoming signal.

Control Section

- MAIN : General Bypass

- TURBO : Turbo Mod *Turbo mod will help to compressor to affect whole signal range. Otherwise, compressor will focus on mid frequencies. This mod added to keep original sign of hardware.

- XFORMER : In/Out Transformers *If you engage XFORMER, in/out ICs will be replaced with transformer to balance it. This will affect to impedance, character, overall sound.

- ANALOG OBSESSION LOGO: Oversampling. It will turn to red when oversampling is engaged.",active,TRUE

Origin is a vintage/lofi plugin created to make your samples sound like they’re straight from an old tape machine.

The main knob is a resampler/bitcrusher with two special filters to make your samples sound “underwater” (this effect can often be heard in Drake songs)

The other four knobs are Tape Saturation, Noise, Movement, and Chorus. Using these 5 powerful controls you can instantly give your samples a vintage vibe.

*Origin is 64 bit only


What’s under the hood of Origin?
Origin was built based on vintage gear to give the most realistic analog sound.

The “Movement” knob (or Wow/Flutter) has a special mode that uses a randomizer algorithm to create realistic tape pitch wobbles.

We also replicated the famous Juno 106 chorus sound with the two classic slow and fast chorus modes.

Finally, the tape saturation modes are modeled from vintage tape machines. Using these in tandem with the noise knob and Resampler, you will get an undeniable vintage tone to your sounds.

Origin Plugin
Origin Plugin
How does the Resampler engine work?
The core of Origin is its resampler, which changes the sample rate of your running audio in real-time. However, reducing the sample rate alone will produce bitcrusher-style artifacts called “images.” In many cases, these aren’t desirable. Removing these images using Origin’s special filters results in an effect similar to a brick-wall lowpass filter, but with an altogether different sonic character.

Rather than turning down the cutoff on a lowpass filter to cut high frequencies, Origin mathematically forbids high frequencies from existing above the resampler cutoff frequency.

How has the hardware counterpart of
the niveau filter been ‘translated’ into
software? Being a part of the mpressor code, this plugin is actually a side effect of a
pretty long and complicated development process... The following provides just the basic idea:
Transferring a complex analog hardware into
digital code is not exactly trivial, especially if the
model is a completely discrete design like the
niveau filter.
The first important task in a project like this is to
fragment the electronic circuitry into separate
functional blocks. These blocks are translated
into software step by step after which they will
be reunited to become a functional plugin.
This first result is measured very accurately and
then compared to the hardware, which leads to
an extensive and very detailed matching process. The work on the graphical user interface
(photography, retouching, rendering) takes
place at the same time.
The final stage is the calibration of the behavior of all the controllers in order to give the
software the ‘feel’ of the real thing. Finally, the
finished code is ported to different plugin interfaces (RTAS/VST/AU/AAX...) and packed into
installation routines.
OVERSAMPLING
The niveau filter plugin benefits from
higher sample rates, as the signals
running through it can be processed
at higher resolutions which result in more precise and closer to analog EQing.
The niveau filter plugin employs the oversampling technique in order to enjoy this advantage
even when lower sample rates are used. This
means that the basic sample rate of a project is
multiplied by a certain factor inside the plugin
without the need to set the complete project to
a higher frequency.
This method consumes a certain amount of CPU
power, but the sonic result speaks for itself. The
niveau filter plugin uses oversampling according to the following rules:
• Project sample rate lower than 50 kHz:
4x oversampling
• Project sample rate lower than 100 kHz:
2x oversampling
• Project sample rate higher than 100 kHz:
No oversampling
MOUSEWHEEL SUPPORT
You do not necessarily have to click
and drag the controllers of the niveau
filter. Instead, try making your settings with the alternative mousewheel control
without clicking on the specific controller first!
The following shortcuts provide some further
comfort:

AU Shift + mouse wheel

It took almost two years of extensive, dare I say ""excessive"", research and development. To create MJUC I've researched and analyzed each and every variable-mu* implementation I could get my hands on to get the best of tube compression into a single processor. In order to do the diversity of this compression topology justice, three different models have been built. These are kind of a time travel though the history of tube compression to capture the essence of each generation. Each model has its own dedicated signal path and dedicated control set. If desired you can tweak the overall tone and saturation of each model with the unique TIMBRE and the DRIVE knob. DRIVE controls the load of the input and output transformers as well as the saturation of the tube gain stages, if applicable. The TIMBRE extends MJUC's use as a tone shaper. ",active,TRUE
